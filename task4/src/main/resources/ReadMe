Copying files using BufferedInputStream is faster then using FileInputStream, NIO Channel, Java Files.
FileInputStream and BufferedInputStream copies data byte by byte. But BufferedInputStream maintains an internal buffer
to store bytes read from the underlying input stream, that's why it is faster.
